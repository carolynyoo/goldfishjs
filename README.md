# playback

'Playback' allows you to navigate the entire file history of a folder or repository. By exploring a file's timeline, you will have the ability to see a file at any point in its existence. You can either watch a file evolve into its most recent state, or watch the file unravel towards an older version in order to follow your footsteps back in time.

Features:
* Playback is a local desktop application built using nw.js
* Modularized database allows local storage of file histories, and allows you to work offline
* Drag & Drop a folder onto the application to begin recording the repository's file history
* Fully traverse a file's timeline both backwards and forwards
* Use 'diff mode' to clearly highlight what has changed between different states of a file
* Full syntax highlighting and error alerts/warnings for a wide-range of languages
